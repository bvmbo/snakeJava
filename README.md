## Technologies

Project is created with:

- Java 20

## Setup

- Java runtime installed
- You need to have a folder "highScores" next to snake.jar file. That folder must contain "highscore.dat" file. The file mantains highscores.

## How to play the game

- Start playing with the WSAD keys.
- If you lose, just close it and re-open it (I will add a restart button possibly).
